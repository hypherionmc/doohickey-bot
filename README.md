## How to get this bot on my server

Currently, I have a very small server running this bot, so I am not allowing just anyone to invite and use my hosted version of this bot. If I am a member of your server, you can simply ask me to invite it. Otherwise, if I don't know you personally, you're out of luck until I can get a stronger server. You can however host your own version of this bot.

## How to get this bot on my server

To host this bot yourself is easy. Just follow the steps below:

* Download the latest version [HERE](https://hypherionmc.me/bot/Doohickey-0.1-all.jar) or grab the latest dev build from [Jenkins](https://ci.hypherionmc.me/job/DoohickeyBot/)
* Create a Discord App (find it on google). Give it a nice name and icon then click on Bot. Add a bot and copy your bot token.
* Give your bot the following permissions:
     * Send Messages
     * Manage Messages
     * Embed Links
     * Attach Files
     * Read Message History
     * Add Reactions
* Save the downloaded JAR file to a folder you can access
* Run command java -jar Doohickey-VERSION-all.jar -a YOURBOTTOKENHERE
* That's it. Your bot should now be working. Don't forget to invite the bot to your server.
